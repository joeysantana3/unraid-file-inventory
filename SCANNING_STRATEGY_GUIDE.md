# NAS Scanner Strategy Guide - Choose the Right Approach

## üéØ **Quick Decision Guide**

**For Terabyte-Scale Directories (like your Archive folder):**

| Scanner | Analysis Time | Start Delay | Best For |
|---------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **Progressive** ‚≠ê | None | **Seconds** | TB+ directories, impatient users |
| **Smart (Fast-Start)** | None | **Seconds** | Large directories, want some optimization |
| **Smart (Full Analysis)** | Hours | **Hours** | ‚ùå NOT for TB directories |
| **Monolithic** | None | Seconds | Small directories (<1TB), proven approach |

**Recommendation: Use Progressive Scanner for your Archive folder!**

## üöÄ **Progressive Scanner (NEW - RECOMMENDED)**

**What it does:**
- **Starts scanning immediately** - no analysis phase
- Creates chunks on-demand as it discovers directories
- Optimizes progressively while running
- Uses conservative resources (6 containers √ó 8 CPUs √ó 8GB RAM)

**Perfect for:**
- ‚úÖ Terabyte-scale directories
- ‚úÖ Users tired of waiting hours for analysis
- ‚úÖ Unknown directory structures
- ‚úÖ Systems with limited resources

**How to use:**
```bash
# Start scanning your Archive folder immediately!
./smart_scanner/run_progressive_scan.sh scan /mnt/user/Archive Archive

# Reduce concurrency if needed
./smart_scanner/run_progressive_scan.sh scan /mnt/user/Archive Archive --max-containers 4

# Monitor progress
./smart_scanner/run_progressive_scan.sh status
```

**Advantages:**
- üöÄ **Zero wait time** - starts in seconds
- üß† **Gets smarter** as it runs
- üõ°Ô∏è **Fault tolerant** - failed chunks don't stop others
- üíæ **Persistent logging** - survives failures
- üìä **Real-time progress** - see results immediately
- üîÑ **Resume capability** - automatically skips already scanned directories

**Disadvantages:**
- üÜï New approach (less tested than others)
- üéØ May not be as optimized as full analysis (but who cares if it actually works!)

## üèÉ **Smart Scanner (Fast-Start Mode)**

**What it does:**
- Skips the analysis phase entirely
- Creates chunks based on top-level directories
- Enhanced logging and error handling

**Perfect for:**
- ‚úÖ Large directories where you don't want to wait
- ‚úÖ Directories with predictable structure
- ‚úÖ When you need the proven smart scanner approach

**How to use:**
```bash
# Use --fast-start to skip analysis
./smart_scanner/run_smart_scan.sh scan /mnt/user/Archive Archive --fast-start

# Combine with resource limits
./smart_scanner/run_smart_scan.sh scan /mnt/user/Archive Archive --fast-start --max-containers 4
```

**Advantages:**
- ‚ö° **No analysis delay** - starts immediately
- üß™ **Proven codebase** - enhanced version of working scanner
- üîç **Great logging** - comprehensive failure analysis
- üõ†Ô∏è **Debug tools** - included failure analysis script

**Disadvantages:**
- üéØ Less intelligent chunking than full analysis
- üîß May create suboptimal chunks for complex structures

## üß† **Smart Scanner (Full Analysis Mode)**

**What it does:**
- Analyzes entire directory structure using `du` and `find`
- Creates optimal chunks based on size analysis
- Can take hours for terabyte directories

**Perfect for:**
- ‚úÖ Smaller directories (<100GB)
- ‚úÖ When you have time to wait
- ‚úÖ Complex nested structures that need optimization

**How to use:**
```bash
# Default mode - includes full analysis
./smart_scanner/run_smart_scan.sh scan /mnt/user/Photos Photos

# Increase timeout for very large directories
./smart_scanner/run_smart_scan.sh scan /mnt/user/Videos Videos --analysis-timeout 7200
```

**Advantages:**
- üéØ **Optimal chunking** - best possible chunk distribution
- üìä **Size awareness** - knows exactly what it's dealing with
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Load balancing** - processes largest chunks first

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚è∞ **Long delays** - hours of analysis for TB directories
- üí∏ **Wasted time** - if analysis fails, you've learned nothing
- üî• **High failure rate** - analysis timeouts are common

## üèóÔ∏è **Monolithic Scanner (Original)**

**What it does:**
- Single approach using many containers for different mount points
- Battle-tested, high throughput
- No chunking - one container per mount

**Perfect for:**
- ‚úÖ Multiple smaller mount points
- ‚úÖ Proven workflows
- ‚úÖ Maximum throughput on suitable directories

**How to use:**
```bash
cd mono_scanner
./run_extreme_parallel.sh full
```

**Advantages:**
- üèÜ **Proven track record** - works reliably for appropriate sizes
- üöÄ **High throughput** - 20k-100k files/second
- üéØ **Simple approach** - no complexity

**Disadvantages:**
- üî• **Gets stuck** on very large directories
- üí• **All-or-nothing** - if one mount fails, it's all lost
- üîß **Limited fault tolerance**

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting Guide**

### If Progressive Scanner Has Issues:
```bash
# Check logs
tail -f /mnt/user/appdata/nas-scanner/progressive_scan_*.log

# Check progress
./smart_scanner/run_progressive_scan.sh status

# Debug any issues
./smart_scanner/debug_scan_failure.py --db-name progressive_catalog.db
```

### If Smart Scanner (Fast-Start) Has Issues:
```bash
# Check logs
tail -f /mnt/user/appdata/nas-scanner/smart_scan_*.log

# Debug issues
./smart_scanner/debug_scan_failure.py

# Try even more conservative settings
./smart_scanner/run_smart_scan.sh scan /mnt/user/Archive Archive --fast-start --max-containers 2
```

### General Troubleshooting:
```bash
# Check Docker daemon
docker info

# Check mount accessibility
ls -la /mnt/user/Archive

# Check available resources
free -h
df -h

# Test worker container
docker run --rm nas-scanner-hp:latest echo "test"
```

## üéØ **Specific Recommendations**

### For Your Archive Folder (Terabytes):
```bash
# RECOMMENDED: Progressive scanner
./smart_scanner/run_progressive_scan.sh scan /mnt/user/Archive Archive

# ALTERNATIVE: Smart scanner with fast-start
./smart_scanner/run_smart_scan.sh scan /mnt/user/Archive Archive --fast-start
```

### For Other Large Directories:
```bash
# Movies, Music, Photos, etc.
./smart_scanner/run_progressive_scan.sh scan /mnt/user/Movies Movies
./smart_scanner/run_progressive_scan.sh scan /mnt/user/Music Music
```

### For Smaller, Well-Organized Directories:
```bash
# Use smart scanner with full analysis
./smart_scanner/run_smart_scan.sh scan /mnt/user/Documents Documents
```

## üîÑ **Resume Capability**

**All scanners now support automatic resume!** If a scan is interrupted (system reboot, container failure, etc.), simply restart the same command and it will skip already completed directories.

### How Resume Works:
- ‚úÖ **Database tracking**: Completed directories stored in `scanned_dirs` table
- ‚úÖ **Automatic detection**: Scanners check for existing data on startup
- ‚úÖ **Smart skipping**: Only process directories that haven't been completed
- ‚úÖ **Visual feedback**: Clear logging shows what's being resumed vs. skipped

### Resume Examples:
```bash
# Progressive scanner resume
./smart_scanner/run_progressive_scan.sh scan /mnt/user/Archive Archive
# Output: "üîÑ RESUME MODE: 1,234,567 existing files, 45 completed chunks"

# Smart scanner resume  
./smart_scanner/run_smart_scan.sh scan /mnt/user/Archive Archive --fast-start
# Output: "üîÑ RESUME MODE: 1,234,567 existing files, 45 completed chunks"
```

### Resume Benefits:
- üöÄ **No lost work** - every completed directory is saved
- ‚ö° **Fast restart** - immediately skips to unfinished work
- üîÑ **Cross-scanner** - can switch between Progressive and Smart scanners
- üìä **Progress tracking** - see exactly how much work remains

## üîç **Database Compatibility**

All scanners use the same database schema, so you can:
- Combine results from different scanners
- Switch between approaches
- Merge databases if needed
- Resume with any scanner regardless of which one started the scan

```bash
# Check any database
sqlite3 /mnt/user/appdata/nas-scanner/progressive_catalog.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM files"
sqlite3 /mnt/user/appdata/nas-scanner/smart_catalog.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM files"

# Check resume status
sqlite3 /mnt/user/appdata/nas-scanner/progressive_catalog.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM scanned_dirs WHERE mount_point='Archive'"
```

## üö® **Never Again Wait Hours for Nothing!**

The key insight: **Start working immediately** rather than analyzing for hours only to potentially fail.

The Progressive Scanner embodies this philosophy:
- ‚úÖ Starts scanning in seconds
- ‚úÖ Optimizes as it learns
- ‚úÖ Never wastes time on failed analysis
- ‚úÖ Always makes progress

**Your terabyte Archive folder will be getting scanned while other approaches are still analyzing!**
